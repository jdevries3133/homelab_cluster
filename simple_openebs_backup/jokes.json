The entire process took no more than twenty minutes. \n\nJoe left town and drove for a couple hours before exiting the highway and driving down a winding county road for another ten minutes. Joe pulled into a service station and parked his car. He sat in his vehicle, loaded five shells into his new Benelli shotgun, and chambered in a shell.\n\nJoe clicked off the safety and walked into the convenience store. There was no one in sight but the attendant behind the counter. Her name was Janice. She tried to run when she saw the shotgun but Joe shot her as she turned. She took some buckshot to the brain and died almost instantly.\n\nJoe walked behind the counter, stepping carefully over Janice, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. \"I've killed a lady. I'm robbing the store,\" Joe told the 911 operator. He then emptied the cash register, walked out to his vehicle, and drove away. \n\nA short ways down the road, Joe came upon another service station. He pulled in and exited his vehicle. The owner of the service station was a capable man named Bill. Bill saw the look in Joe's eyes when Joe approached the door of the service station, and he saw the gun in his hand. Bill was ready with his own shotgun by the time Joe raised his, and Bill pumped a slug into Joe's abdomen.\n\nBill immediately called for an ambulance and approached Joe with compassion. \"Let me help you, son.\"\n\nAs Bill tended to Joe's wounds as best as he could, it became clear that Joe might not survive. Bill asked him, \"Why did you do it, son? Why did you bring that damn gun into my store? I had to shoot you. What, were you going to rob me? Why?\"\n\nAs the light of life flickered in Joe's eyes, with his dying breath he responded, \"Damn it all. Shamu and Moby Dick put me up to it. They are waiting outside for me right now. I'm gonna go get them. Be right back, mister.\"\n\nAnd with that, Joe died. Bill would go on to give a full account of Joe's actions and his last words to the police and to the press. Then, the following morning, the Sunday paper headline read,\n\n\"The Outlaw Joe Sees Whales\"",

They are also the ones that people will trim to prevent birds from flying away. Crows have 5 pinion feathers while ravens have 6.

He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. \"Hi, I came for the french lesson today\" our guy said. \"Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week.\" \"So there is no one that know any french here?\" \"No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine\" \"Uhm ok. What does it say?\" \"I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone.\" Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.\n\nThe day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. \"Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers\" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. \n\"That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!\" our guy thought, and so he did.\n\nLuckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. \"Let me see\" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open. A gust of wind blew the note out of their hands and out one of the windows, and they never found it. Neither did our guy find out what the note said... Not even I know... Sorry\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.    \n\nThen, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.\n\nWhat was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.   \n\nI was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.\n\nI accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I\u2019d never match it\u2019s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.  \n\nI screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, \u2018you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!\u2019  I was curious, as well, so that\u2019s precisely what I did.\n\nI cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!\n\n\u201cOh, yeah\u201d, responded the old lady.   \u201cThat was one of our three legged chickens.\u201d\n\nMy buddy reacted, \u201cthree legged chickens?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cwell, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr\u2019s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that\u2019s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!\u2019  \n\nJr\u2019s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!\n\n\u201cSounds like a great idea!\u201d, I said.  I continued, \u201cSo\u2026..how do they taste?\u201d\n\nJr\u2019s smile evaporated as Maw responded, \u201cdon\u2019t know.   Can\u2019t catch \u2018em.\u201d\n",

Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine. \n\nAs the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.\n\nCurious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal. \n\nObviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited & happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.\n\nThough he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.\n\nAfter a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.\n\nConfused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.\n\nThe chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today.

The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. \n\nMODERN VERSION: \n\nThe ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. \n\nCome winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. \n\nCBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? \n\nThen a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with \"green bias,\" and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. \n\nKermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the \"Temperatures of the 80's.\"\n\nRichard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his \"fair share.\" Finally, the EEOC drafts the \"Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act\" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. \n\nHillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. \n\nThe ant loses the case. \n\nThe story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. \n\nThe ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of \"fairness\" has dawned in America.

I lives with my parents!\" he thought to himself:\"but how did this guy know? Do I know this guy?\" He then did a quick brain search, but couldn't think of a single Asian guy he knew. So he maintained his composure, and replied calmly: \"Sir, I'm sure you mistook me for someone else. I moved out the day I enrolled in college.\"\n\n5 minutes later, the Asian guy tried again to start a conversation by saying:\"So, did your dad get the tenure? Or still an assistant prof?\"\n\nThe young liberal arts student got flabbergasted! His father actually teach in the same college he attends! What's going on? Is this Asian guy a family friend? He searched through his mind once more. Nope, couldn't think of any Asian guy he had ever made acquaintance under any circumstance. Probably just some random drunk. So he replied: \"Look, I don't know who you are but you better leave me alone. My father is a lawyer, not a teacher.\"\n\nSoon an African guy walked in and sat on his left. The African guy took a glance at him and went:\"Hey there young fellow, how's your culture study thesis going?\"\n\nThe young liberal arts student was completely baffled. \"Oh my god.\" He thought.\"I am working on a culture study thesis! How the hell did he know! I'm positive I don't know this guy!\"\n\n\"OK!\" the young liberal arts student finally snapped:\"OK I lied. I live with my parents. I have a father that is teaching at the same college I go to. And I'm a culture studies major. OK, you got me, you happy? But how the fuck did you know? I don't fucking know you! I don't fucking know any of you! Just wtf is going on???\"\n\nThe bartender turned around. He picked up a cup and started cleaning.

You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest.\"\n\nSatan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. \n\nEaster Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. \n\nOne hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. \n\nBy 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. \n\nBy noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. \n\nAt 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. \n\nBy 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. \n\n2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces \"JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!\" \n\nSatan is furious. \"How can this be?\" He asks. \"I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!\"\n\nJesus taunts Satan. \"Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off.\"\n\n\"Your computer was shut off, too!\" Satan retorts. \"I guess neither of us win!\" \n\nGod, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. \n\n\"How can this be?\" Satan snarls. \"I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!\" \n\n\"Satan, my friend,\" God says, \"You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... \n\nJesus saves.\" \n",

The man then drinks both of the beverages.\n\n\nThe man then spots a good friend across the bar, and notices that his friend is with a woman that looked nothing like the friend's wife. The man confronts his friend when he is alone, and the friend says\n\n\n\"Actually, that's my sister. She's visiting town from Pittsburgh.\"\n\n\nThe friend then pulls out his phone and proves this with some family photos and their last few text conversations. The man, realizing he misunderstood the situation, apologizes to his friend and his sibling and walks out of the bar, wishing both of them a good night.\n\n\nThe man walks down the street when he watches two people dressed as apes, three women dressed as clowns, and two kids in a tandem horse costume. The man knows it is Halloween, so this succession of people doesn't phase him or anyone else on the sidewalk.\n\n\nThe man reaches his house and, noting that the lights are off, quietly unlocks the door so as to not wake up his sleeping wife. He slowly tiptoes his way up the stairs when he misses a step and stumbles down three stairs. This wakes up his wife, and she walks out of their bedroom and says\n\n\n\"Are you okay sweetie?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" the man says, \"I just stumbled a bit. Sorry I'm late, I ran across Jim at the bar and we had a chat.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's alright, honey. Just get to bed soon, okay? I need you to get Billy to his friend's birthday party tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\"Okay, sweetest.\" Said the man. He doesn't really want to do it, since it means he has to talk with the other kids' parents while he's there, and the man isn't very good at small talk.\n\n\n\nBut he loves his son, so he will do it anyway.

The son explained the situation to the lady and told her that even though he has no money, he does have this duck. The woman thinks for a while, and decides to take the duck as payment since she knew a guy that could help her prepare the duck so that she could cook it for dinner.\n\nSo after they have sex, the woman is flabbergasted at just how magnificent the son was in bed. She even offered him a freebie but being the polite guy that he is, he refused. So the woman, desperate for another round, offered the duck back as payment, the son agrees and so they have sex again. \nLater, the son leaves the brothel with the duck. On their way back home a truck appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and hits the duck, killing it. Feeling bad, the driver offers to pay the son for the duck. Not knowing how much it was worth the son settles for $20. The driver happily obliges, pays him the $20, and they both go on their ways.\n\nFinally the son gets home when his dad asks him \"So son, how was it?\" The son replies \"I dunno dad, you tell me.\" \"Ok, so tell me what happened\" replied the dad. The son replied \"Well dad, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 20 bucks for a fucked up duck.\"",

        "body": "I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.\n\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.\n\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \"Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!\" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \"How many Indians could there be?\" said by General Custer. \"Looks like a good day for a drive!\" by JFK. \"There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!\" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\n\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\n\nUnfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \"It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.\"\n\nLater on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n\nFriends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!",

So he got in contact with Francis, the Bishop, to get help in spreading word around local businesses that Dave was a good, honest chap ready to undertake work.\n\n  In no time at all Dave got a break- fast food. \n\n  He showed up at 7 am for the first day. Jim, an old friend of Francis the Bishop, was sympathetic to Dave's cause and was happy in giving him a dozen hours a week. He was also aware of Dave's one flaw that Francis warned him about: Dave tended to daydream and become forgetful, aloof or even careless during monotonous tasks. This had led to him losing the Church keys on a few occasions. Leading Choir practice in the driving rain was not a pleasant experience.\n\n So Jim was on the lookout and intended to keep a keen eye on Dave's performance. \n\n  \"Dave mate. I haven't trained you in food safety yet. So for this week you're responsible for keeping the joint clean before, during, and after the chippy is open for service. Right. Any questions? Good man,\"\n\n  So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.\n\n  Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave's mismanagement.\n\n  \"Jim, look I'm really sorry. But I'm getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don't me cleaning.\"\n\n  So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.\n\n  \"Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I'm sure you'll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They've been paid for so don't worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n  Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant. \n\n  \"So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!\"\n\n  Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.\n\n  Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.\n\n  To the sheepish priest he said, \"Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He'll give you something to do.\"\n\n  Dave nodded vigorously, \"Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won't be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!\"\n\n  \"Yeah. Good. Just don't burn this place down.\"\n\n  6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn't see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. \"Don't fret too much\", Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. \"Phil was happy with Dave's work and didn't mention any hiccups.\"\n\n  A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.  \n\n  It was nearing the end of Dave's vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, \"Dave, top job. You've done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They're so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?\"\n\n  \"It's nothing, really Jim!\"\n\n  \"No, no! Please tell! You're one of us. Even if you're leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?\"\n\n  \"It's simple, Jim,\" Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim's throat.\n\n  \"Oh?\" sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n   \"Simple, Jim. I'm just a good friar.\"",

One night they decided to take a break and go visit the circus that just pulled into the vineyard.  \n  \nThe circus was amazing and they enjoyed a peaceful night not worrying about babies, as they were leaving they noticed a small tent off to the side and they entered it. An old wrinkly prune sat in front of a table and spoke to them \"I know what you seek, a child to call your own, I can help you but it comes at a price.\" \"Anything\" Mrs Grape replied \"we have money, antiques, anything!\" \"No, no, no, drink this potion, in 6 nights you will give birth. He will not be handsome, he will not be timid, if you can not love him, you will return to us and he will live here in the circus, yes?\" The prune asked as she handed a small bottle to Mrs Grape. Knowing she would love him no matter what he was like, Mrs Grape drank the potion.  \n \nTrue to the prunes word Mrs Grape fell pregnant, six nights later she gave birth, he was small, very dry, brown and shrivelled. Mr & Mrs Grape tried to care for the little boy, they nurtured him, stayed awake with him, gave him everything they had but he never stopped crying and once he could move he never stopped trying to destroy their house. After several weeks they were exhausted. The little one never grew, he stayed dry, small and wrinkly, the stress was becoming too much.  \n  \nOne day Mr Grape returned from work with a small cage, he convinced Mrs Grape they needed a nights sleep and to decide in the morning if they would return the child to the circus. They locked him in the cage and moved him to the furthest part of the vineyard. For the first time in weeks they held each other and slept. In the morning with a fresh outlook they knew something was not right with their child, they walked hand in hand to the cage, ready to take him to the Prune.  \n  \nMr Grape spoke sadly \"I'm sorry buddy, we've tried, we are exhausted and I don't even think you understand us?

Someone who had committed adultery would say they had \"fallen\". \n\nThis seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the Mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. \n\nThe priest said, \"You have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen.\" \n\nThe Mayor started to laugh, realizing that no-one had told the new priest about the code word. \n\nBefore the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said, \"I don't know what you're laughing about.

He is filled with nostalgia and starts feeling better already.\nThey have coffee and chat for a little bit and the executive says he wants to do some farm manual labor to take his head off work and forget about the city life for a while.\nThe farmer says there is plenty of work to do around the farm and the executive can help him. So the farmer tells him to wake up early the next day and meet him at the stable.\nWhen the executive gets to the stable the next day the farmer shows him piles of bags and say:\n- This is all the horse manure we collected for the past 3 months. Your job will will be to spread it over that empty field to fertilize the soil for the next season.\nTwo hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.\nThe farmer is surprised. \"This usually takes us a whole day! I only planned work for you for tomorrow\".\nSo the farmer inspects the field and is astonished the executive did such a good job in so little time. So he tells him to take the rest of the day off and meet him at he chicken coop the next morning.\nThe next morning the farmer says: \"We got a big chicken order from one of our clients and we have to deliver it ready for processing. Your job will be to cut the chickens head off so we can send them out. Again, two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do. The farmer is surprised now even more. He didn't think his city cousin could manage farm jobs so well.\n\"This usually takes us two days, this is impressive! Meet me at the orange plantation tomorrow morning.\"\nThe next morning the farmer says: \"The orange harvesting wasn't very good this year. We only got this 10 boxes of oranges. Your job will be to separate them in 3 piles, big oranges, medium oranges and small oranges. If anyone is bad just discard it.\"\nTo the farmers surprise, it's the end of the day and his executive cousin is still not back for dinner, so he goes to check on him. When he gets there is sees his cousin working out still on the first box, comparing sizes on two oranges, then picking a third one and changing it's original pile... The farmer is puzzled, screeching his head. \"what's the matter? I thought you would finish this in no time\"\nThe executive looks at him and says: \"I'm an executive. We are really good at spreading shit and cutting heads. But we really struggle when it comes to making decisions\"",

        "body": "During the Yongle Emperor's reign in the Ming Dynasty, there was an imperial proclamation posted on the Quintuple Pailou of Front-Gate Street in Beijing. This proclamation gripped the attention of the entire city. The people of the three front gates gathered up like a storm. Monks, Taoists, Muslims, Confuscianists, Scholars of a hundred schools, farmers, artisans, merchants, and all the other professions in the world, along with officials, eunuchs, bowmen, arrowfolk, cart-pushers, pole carriers, coal sellers, charcoal sellers, needle and thread sellers, pie and noodle sellers, pot-fixers and garlic sellers, pancake and doughnut sellers, tea and egg sellers.... all these people! They don't know what happened with the country, and why there was a proclamation, so they gathered up to get a look.\n\nAt this time, from the north there came a dude, whose last name is Sun and first name is Delong and a butcher in the East Quaduple Pailou Butcher's Street, and knows how to catch and butcher pigs. He originally came from Dengzhou, Shandong, and is around 40 years old. He likes to drink. Today he just came from the butchery, and held his pig hook in his armpit, which is a white waxed pole as thick as a walnut, a meter and half in length, and two bronze hooks at the tip. If the pig runs away, he can hook it back with one pull. He held his purse in one hand and his ledger in his other armpit. He had a rope for a belt and pewter liquor bottle hanging on it. The bottle was polished so much it lit up like a lamp from the reflection of the sun. He wore a cotton cloth robe, but it's checkered pattern? Why? Because he wipes his knife on it after he cuts everything, meat, intestines, whatever. As the days gone by it went the same way as the razor sharpener in the salon.\n\nSo he just had the drink of his life from the liquor bar after work, and his legs were quaking as his words slurred, \"This wine may be sorghum water, but it conquers the legs first on a man, can't see anything in front of me, like I've been possessed by a ghost!\" He saw that there's a circle of people surrounding the proclamation? \"I gotta see what this is about\", so he forced his way in. He saw the proclamation, but he's illiterate, so he asks around. He taps another dude on the shoulder, \n\n\"Yo! What's this shit?\"\n\nOther guy says, \"Slow down, man, careful you don't get a side stitch. This is an imperial proclamation!\"\n\n\"The hell is an imperial proclamation?\"\n\n\"Something the Emperor posted!\"\n\n\"Can you read it for me?\"\n\n\"Sure thing! Listen here, 'Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, his rescript reads as thus: In the seventh year of Chenghua, the Ryukyu Kingdom sends their tribute. In reality, however, they sent an old Taoist to test his power against us... \"\n\n\"All right stop! Don't read anymore. I don't understand any of this!?\"\n\n\"Oh, so I did this for nothing?\"\n\n\"So let me ask, what's the first two phrases?\"\n\n\"Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, His rescript reads as thus?\"\n\n\"The hell is 'His rescript reads as thus?'\"\n\n\"If the Emperor speaks, it's 'his rescript reads as thus'\"\n\n\"So what would be for me speaking?\"\n\n\"Uh... I don't know what would be reading as thus.\"\n\n\"Fine, continue\"\n\nThis man however's already tired of it since he has to read and then explain. He figured he might as well just tell Sun what it means, \"So basically the Ryukyu's are a vassal state that sends tribute and their declaration as our servant every year, but this year they sent an old Taoist, who knows how to do 36 styles of silent debate, and can recite 70 volumes of the 'Diamond Sutra', he's coming to to test his power against us Chinese. If we beat him, then they'll continue their tribute and declaration every year. If we can't, or nobody takes up the challenge, then they the Ryukyus are now the lords, and we Great Ming are now the vassal states. The Emperor thus sends out a proclamation seeking able people, who knows how to silently debate and recite the Diamond Sutra, to take up the challenge. If they can beat that old Taoist, the Emperor will give them any amounts of money or as high of a court position as possible! But it's useless for you, you don't know how to silent debate or recite the Diamond Sutra.\"\n\nHe just had to go there, because this Sun Delong has a name for being a \"jack of all trades\". If you say he's not capable of something, he's going to get mad, \"Stop! How do you know I don't know how to silent debate, or how to read the Diamond Sutra?\"\n\n\"Oh? So you can?\"\n\n\"If I don't, what do I have this head for?\"\n\n\"Ah! Then that's great! Take the proclamation and go challenge the old Taoist!\"\n\nSun was walking up to take the proclamation when the other guy thought that he should make absolutely sure, so he asked. \"The imperial proclamation says the old Taoist knows 36 styles of silent debate, do you?\"\n\n\"How many styles?\"\n\n\"36.\"\n\n\"I know 72.\"\n\n\"Wow! Twice the styles... The old Taoist can recite 70 volumes of the Diamond Sutra.\"\n\n\"And the Diamond Sutra I can recite is endless!\"\n\n\"Then take the proclamation.\"\n\n\"I can't reach.\"\n\n\"So what's that in your hand then?\"\n\n\"My pig hook.\"\n\n\"So use it to hook the proclamation then.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nHe hooked the proclamation off the post. The soldiers who were guarding the proclamation saw that a drunk had taken the proclamation, so they took out their rope and tied him up, pushing him to see the official in charge.\n\nThe official in charge is the Imperial Secretary Xie. However, Sun refused to kneel and instead turned his face in disgust, \"So what's your last name?\"\n\nMinister Xie was baffled, \"So he's prosecuting me instead the other way around? or what?\" He thought. \"It's 'Xie'.\"\n\n\"Minister Xie, do you have common sense?\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to take the old Taoist's challenge tied up?\"\n\n\"Oh? So you're the sorcerer?\"\n\nMinister Xie immediately reprimands the two soldiers. \"You reprehensible idiots! How can you bring the sorcerer to me tied up!\" He personally unties Sun. There's only one seat in the office. \"Sorcerer, please sit.\" Of course, it's supposed to be Minister Xie's seat, but Sun doesn't know that, so he sits right away. Not only does he sit, but he also annoyingly says, \"Oh, where would you sit then?\"\n\nMinister Xie has to reply, \"Then I'll stand.\"\n\n\"So, Minister, where do we find this damned Taoist?\"\n\n\"He's living in the Golden Terrace Institute in the Legation Quarter. That being said we must first go meet his majesty.\"\n\n\"What's a majesty?\"\n\n\"The Emperor\"\n\n\"Oh great, long time no see for us bros.\" Apparently, Sun's bros with the Emperor.\n\n\"So sorcerer, do you want to ride a horse or a litter to the palace?\"\n\n\"Neither.\"\n\n\"Neither? Then what sorcery will you use?\"\n\n\"I want to ride an ass.\"\n\n\"Ride an ass? Where do we find one for you?\"\n\n\"No ass, no go.\"\n\nMinister Xie was flabbergasted, but he personally went to the Zhangyi Gate to rent a donkey foal so Sun could ride it to the Palace. He had Sun wait in the East Court in the Palace.\n\nMinister Xie reports to the Emperor, and the Emperor was pleased. He orders an immediate audience. However, Minister Xie ponders a bit and decides that he can't let Sun see the Emperor, because Sun hasn't practiced the proper protocols in the Ministry of Rites, and he doesn't know what might come out of Sun's mouth. If Sun goes up to the Emperor and says something like \"Yo bro, long time no see\", then Minister Xie would certainly lose his head. Thus, Minister Xie immediately says, \"Your majesty, the sorcerer isn't a native of Beijing, and just came recently. He also hasn't practiced the propr protocols in the Ministry of Rites, so I fear he may offend your majesty with his improper behavior. If it were up to me, I would send him to take the challenge first, and have an audience after. If he defeats the old Taoist, then it's easier to forgive his transgressions in behavior.\"\n\nThus, the Emperor agrees and sends for the old Taoist in the Golden Terrace Institute, telling him that China has in fact found someone to accept his challenge. The old Taoist orders two 10-meter platforms be built in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and a table, incense burners, offerings, candelabrum, scroll paper, cinnabar brush, vegetables, grains, and a bowl or rainwater.\n\n\"Whatever your sorcerer wants, tell him to prepare himself.\" The old Taoist says, but Minister Xie ponders and just orders the same things for Sun. The orders were fulfilled quickly. The old Taoist shook his robe, and a dark whirlwind blew, lifting him onto his platform. The officials in court were shocked.\n\nThe emperor sends his edict, \"Minister Xie, ask our sorcerer to take the challenge, and also ride the wind or cloud up to the platform.\" Minister Xie immediately goes to the East Court to find the \"sorcerer\". He goes in and sees Xun sleeping on the floor. Minister Xie goes up and yells, \"Sorcerer! Wake up!\"\n\n\"Quit disturbing me!\"\n\n\"Who's disturbing you! Pull him up.\"\n\nSun rubs his eyes, and looks around. This is inside the palace, and it's golden all over.\n\n\"Ay! Old Minister! Where the hell is this?\"\n\n\"In the palace.\"\n\n\"What am I doing here in the palace?\"\n\n\"What? Did you forget? You're here to take the old Taoist's challenge. He's on the platform waiting for you. The Emperor also moved his throne outside to see you two duel.\"\n\nSun was terrified, \"What?!\" He was, of course, completely drunk, and after sleeping for so long he had forgotten pretty much everything. After Minister Xie explains, he starts thinking: I've drank too much, and in my drunken stupor I took the imperial proclamation, I'm just a goddamn merchant, how the hell do I know how to duel with old Taoists? Besides, it appears that this guy is from another country, so he must have evil intentions. Now I've really done it! He immediately slaps himself in the face four times, \"I'm an idiot! an idiot!\"\n\nHe kneels down to Minister Xie, \"Old minister, I've had too much to drink! It was the alcohol! I'm a butcher, please find someone else to duel! I can't do this at all! If this isn't enough for you, please slap me some more, and let me go with the wind like a kite!\"\n\n\"Ah!?\"\n\nMinister Xie's rage boiled over and he shook, his hat quaking. He's both angry and scared, \"Oh? You had too much to drink? You're right, this is way too much! Can you still feel your head on your neck? Just slap you and let you go? You can say this to me, fine, if I tell the same to the Emperor, then I've deceived him and failed the country. Deceiving him might be no big deal, but the country will be in trouble. This old Taoist is already there, what is His Majesty going to say to him? How will the country handle the shame? Neither of us will keep our heads for this. You're the drunk idiot that pulled the proclamation and tricked the official in charge, I'm the one that failed in office and allowed idiots into the palace, and deceived the Emperor and failed the country. Even if we get our deserved death, what is the Emperor to do? He will lose face, and our China will lose face. The Ryukyu will be lord and Ming will be vassal, and the Empire will be destroyed and our people enslaved!\"\n\nSun Delong hears this and also starts to panic, which brought the alcohol back into his bloodstream, so he jumps up.\n\n\"Old Minister, it's fine! If neither of us will live, then it's easy to deal with. If we're to die regardless of whether I duel the old Taoist or not, then let's just duel so at least we'll die with our wounds in front. Even if we lose our head, it's just going to be a scab the size of a bowl. Maybe I'm not as good at sorcery as he is, but it's not certain he can fight as well as me! Let's go find him.\"\n\nMinister Xie hears this and wonders, \"Does he know how to duel or not?\" \n\n\"Just go!\" Minister Xie, out of options, leads him to the platforms and points to the one in the east, \"See? He's already meditating up there.\"\n\nSun Delong takes a look and says, \"Then I'm going on the other one. If we go on the same one, we'd fight for that territory.\"\n\n\"Just go!\"\n\n\"How tall is it?\"\n\n\"Ten meters!\"\n\n\"Ten meters? Even if it's 30, that's no big deal, attendants!.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Get me a ladder.\"\n\n\"Ladders are a no-go, the Emperor has already ordered that you ride the wind or clouds, because the old Taoist took the wind up.\"\n\nThe old Taoist, in fact, did not ride the wind. It's a trick. Inside his sleeve is an iron cylinder with wolf manure, charcoal, and Mayflower gloryberry inside, lit up. When he needs it, he shakes his robes and the cylinder's cover falls off, black smoke then pours out of it from his sleeves and neckline. Wolf manure provides the constant burn, but it's the mayflower that provides the black smoke that looks like a dark whirlwind surrounding him. Thus, with that cover he simply climbs up using hooks worn on his arm and legs.\n\nSun Delong hears about wind and cloud, so he asks, \"What kind of wind?\"\n\n\"Obviously, the Guiding Wind.\"\n\n\"All I know is passing wind.\"\n\n\"That won't do.\"\n\n\"Fuck it then, I'm not going without a ladder.\"\n\n\"Don't!\"\n\nSun Delong again panics and paces in circles around the platform.\n\n\"Don't go there, the Emperor is there!\"\n\n\"I need to sneak a peek\"\n\nMinister Xie was annoyed. Who peeks at the Emperor?\n\n\"Who's sitting there?\" Sun asks,\n\n\"The Emperor, obviously.\"\n\n\"So who's the eight giants next to him?\"\n\n\"That's the guards, The Golden Macemen.\"\n\n\"What's that in their hands?\"\n\n\"The Golden Maces\"\n\n\"So bring the tallest one to me. I have something to discuss with him.\"\n\nMinister Xie goes and sees that it is in fact Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Bai Wenyuan.\n\n\"Lord Bai, here's a friend that wants to meet you, the sorcerer Sun who's here to duel. This is Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Lord Bai Wenyuan\"\n\n\"Oh, Minister Bai, good tiding to you, please help me.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need to get up there\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with me?\"\n\n\"Without you I can't get up there.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Think, this platform is ten meters tall, how tall are you?\"\n\n\"Me? His majesty only picks the tallest for his guard. I'm in fact two meters seven.\"\n\n\"What about the golden mace?\"\n\n\"Handle is four meters two, three decimeters for the mace, total four meters five.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's right. Four meters five plus two meters seven, that's seven meters two. It's only a bit from ten meters.\"\n\nWhat's he calculating? Bai Wenyuan wonders.\n\n\"So, just let me sit on the mace, and you catapult me up there...\" Sun says.\n\n\"What? I...'ve never heard of this!\"\n\n\"If you don't, I'm leaving.\"\n\nMinister Xie immediately runs over, \"Lord Bai, please help him and just give it a try.\"\n\nBai Wenyuan was shaking with anger. Just what the hell is this? But he complies anyway. He lets Sun climb onto the mace, and vaults. With his strength, Sun flies 14 meters into the air, way past the platform. It would seem like Sun is in trouble because of the fall, but he was actually okay. Remember he has that meter and half hook? He reached the hook out to the platform to break his fall, and slid down it once it reached. Not only was he not injured, but he actually arrived standing up.\n\nThe old Taoist was meditating with his eyes closed, so he didn't see what Sun Delong was doing at all. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was Sun descending from 14 meters in the air. He was frightened, \"Wow! There are indeed talented people in China! I only rode the whirlwind, they came straight from heaven!\"\n\nHe then takes a look at Sun Delong and was even more frightened, \"This man has fortuitous clouds at his feet and golden light protecting his body!\" The reason is, of course, that Sun had kicked the incense pot over when he landed, and the incense ash poured out around him. As for the golden light, it's because of his oiled cotton clothes, which reflected brightly in the sunlight. Usually in battle, the side that loses their heart first loses, the old Taoist was shaking with fear. He warns himself to be careful, which only psyched himself out more. He holds out his hand and speaks.\n\n\"Amita!\"\n\nEven though he's short, his voice was like a bronze bell. The old Taoist has invoked his first chant, and Sun thinks to himself that he must return one.\n\n\"Good stuff!\"\n\nSo the old Taoist says:\n\n\"Amitabha!\"\n\nAnd he hears that the old Taoist has added a syllable, so he adds a bunch.\n\n\"A bunch of junk stuff!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was baffled. \"I don't have that much stuff!\" He thinks, \"Might as well silently debate then!\" He holds out a finger, which means:\n\n\"Don't underestimate me, I have The One Buddha saluting me!\" \n\nSun of course, doesn't know that. He says he knew how to silently debate, but it's not the same thing. It's the kind of debate he has with customers in the butchery. He sees that the old Taoist has held out a finger, and was enraged, \n\n\"What's this? He thinks he's one generation older than me? Fuck you!\"\n\nHe holds out two fingers. What does he mean?\n\n\"You think you're my uncle? Your dad's two generations behind me!\"\n\nThe old Taoist thought, \"Wow! My one finger is The One Buddha saluting me, so he counters with Two Saints shielding him!\" He then raises three fingers, which means \"The Three August ones rules the Earth\". Sun Delong doesn't know, but he thinks:\n\n\"This is a trick, he raises one so I give him two, he's going to give me three, but if I give him four he's giving me five, and I don't have six fingers to give back. Therefore, I'm taking the five first!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was amazed, \"The Three August Ones rules the Earth\" is indeed countered by \"The Five Emperors are sovereign.\" He then slaps his chest, meaning \"The One Buddha in my heart.\" Sun was again enraged, \"So now you think you're my father-in-law?\" He slaps his head, which means \"You think you're my father-in-law? I'm slapping you and your daughter!\" The old Taoist again saw that his \"The One Buddha in my heart\" being countered by \"Heaven is above my head\".\n\nThe old Taoist had to evaluate his options - he couldn't win the silent debate, so he took the scroll paper and pulls his sword out. \"What? Is he going to slit his own throat?\" The Taoist cuts the paper into three pieces and drew a charm on each with the cinnabar brush. He lights the candelabrum and then the scroll with the candle. He starts chanting as he shakes his sword, and the scroll starts burning brighter, which he wants to use to burn Sun Delong. Sun Delong taunts him, \"Playing with fire? Aren't you a bit old for this? If you play with fire too much you'll piss your bed at night, and your mother will spank you!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was incensed, so he continues to spin the fire, which grew from the size of a teacup to a plate. Why didn't it burn out the scroll? It's because the old Taoist has applied a special formula with the cinnabar to keep it burning. He threw the flaming scroll at the other platform, and it flew towards Sun's face. Sun dodges to the left and lets it pass, but his hair, which Ming Dynasty people usually wear in a bun on their head, caught fire, and half of his head was burnt off. Luckily for Sun, there was a bowl of rainwater on the platform, so he took it and put the fire out. The Old Taoist sees the charm has failed, so he starts burning the second one. Sun Delong sees this and was angered, \"Oh, so you're kicking me while I'm down? You want to burn the other half so I'd have to become a monk and go beg for food with you? Fuck that! I'm attacking first!\" He takes his hook and aims it at the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist was still chanting with his eyes closed, which gave Sun enough time to aim. He throws the pig hook tail first towards the old Taoist \"Look at this stuff!\" If he didn't yell this he'd hit the old Taoist in the face, but since he yelled, the old Taoist opens his eyes and sees something flying towards him. \"Amita!\" He yells and dodges to the right. The pole of course missed, but the hooks behind it didn't, and cleaves two strands of flesh right off the old Taoist's cheek. \"Amitabhaaaaaaaaaaaa!\" The old Taoist screams. Sun Delong taunts again, \"Doesn't pay attention, take this stuff!\" \n\nThe old Taoist examines the pig hook and doesn't know what it is, and becomes more frightened, \"Aya! I forgot he descended from heaven and has fortuitous clouds and golden light shielding him! This man is a true arhat and even has Gautama Buddha's Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook!\"\n\nSun Delong was delighted! \"Idiot! My hair can still grow back, what pot-fixer can repair your face?\"\n\nThis only served to frighten the old Taoist more, as he also noticed Sun's purse and wine bottle hanging on his belt. In his panic he thought they were the hundred-treasure pouch and heaven-flipping seal. As he kept frightening himself, he finally decided to use the foremost stratagem of the thirty six - retreat!\n\n\"Amita! I'm going back to my country to report!\"\n\n\"If you leave I'm using my power!\"\n\n\"No, Don't! I'll report to your Emperor first!\"\n\nThe old Taoist leaps off the platform and runs up to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, kowtowing again and again. \"Please forgive your vassal's transgressions! Please forgive your vassal's transgressions!\"\n\nOf course, the Emperor didn't understand any of it. He only heard the stuff about \"Amita\" and \"Good stuff\" and didn't get it. He then saw the old Taoist setting things on fire and then Sun Delong putting it out with water. \"Of course! Water beats fire!\" He then saw the old Taoist lighting fire again, and was annoyed, but then while he was staring at the fire, he saw that the Taoist's cheeks were then gashed. He clapped happily, \"We've won! Good! Good!\" He saw that the old Taoist has descended and knew that the old Taoist admitted defeat.\n\n\"What do you have to say?\"\n\n\"Ah! Your majesty! Please forgive us! We admit defeat and will tribute and declare every year!\"\n\n\"Of course! We must know, however, what is 'Amita'?\"\n\n\"That's how we Taoists greet people.\"\n\n\"What about his 'Good stuff'?\"\n\n\"I don't know, what's good stuff?\"\n\n\"What about 'Amitabha'?\"\n\n\"It's also a greeting.\"\n\n\"What about his 'A bunch of junk stuff!'?\"\n\n\"He has too much stuff\" The old Taoist points to his cheek \"Look at this stuff I took!\"\n\n\"Then what was that finger?\"\n\n\"The One Buddha saluting me!\" \n\n\"What about his two?\"\n\n\"Two Saints shielding him!\" \n\n\"What about your three?\"\n\n\"'The Three August Ones rules the Earth', then your sorcerer counters with 'The Five Emperors are sovereign.' I slapped my chest meaning 'The One Buddha in my heart', and he counters with a slap on his head meaning 'Heaven is above my head'\".\n\n\"So what about that fire?\"\n\n\"Please forgive me! I wanted to toss him off the platform.\"\n\n\"For a man of mercy you sure are merciless! What about your face?\"\n\n\"Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook.\"\n\nSo then he was dismissed and goes to await the Emperor's judgment.\n\nThe Emperor's attendant then looks on the platform \"Wait, why is our sorcerer still up there?\" Of course, Sun Delong couldn't get down, and he's pacing on the platform wondering if he had won or not. The Emperor sees and says, \"Our sorcerer must be wounded by that demon fire, have somebody help him down.\" So immediately a ladder was raised and Sun Delong gets off the platform. Minister Xie walks over and says, \"The Emperor requires your audience, just kowtow and try not to speak.\" Why? He's still afraid of that possible \"Hey bro, long time no see\". Sun Delong enters the Hall of Supreme Harmony and salutes the Emperor, \"Hey!\" \n\nAre you going to bite me? The Emperor wonders, but then Sun says.\n\n\"I am kowtowing to your majesty.\"\n\nOf course, since he won, the Emperor was happy, \"Raise your head.\"\n\nNormally, it's against protocol to raise your head and you're supposed to say, \"It's a crime to\" and the Emperor would then say, \"We pardon it\", but Sun Deleng doesn't know that and raises his head immediately to stare at the Emperor, \"What?\"\n\nThe Emperor laughed, \"So did you win or not?\"\n\nSun Delong is afraid of this, because he doesn't know if he won or not. He lowers his head. The Emperor asks again, \"Did you win or not?\" He turns his head and sees the old Taoist, so when the Emperor asks a third time, he answers, \"Your majesty, I can't answer that. If I say I won, then I'm boasting, but if I say I didn't win, what did I come here for? If you don't have the skills you don't get the kills.\"\n\nMinister Xie is annoyed, \"What's all this small talk?\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me who won, you should ask him. If he says I lost then I lost, if I said I won then I won. Old Taoist! If you say I lost, then let's go back up there for round two!\"\n\nThe old Taoist holds his cheek and says, \"Please no! He won!\"\n\n\"What's the sorcerer's name?\" The Emperor asks.\n\n\"My name is Sun Delong and I live in the butchery street. The Delong Butchery is mine. I've never cheated a customer and you'll always get 16 ounces to your pound!\"\n\nWho asked him about that?\n\n\"So after you met, what's 'Amita'?\" The Emperor asks.\n\n\"Oh that's simple! I know him.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was surprised. He knows me? I don't know him?\n\n\"This man is here to beg for money.\"\n\n\"Why 'Amita'?\"\n\n\"In my butchery, whenever someone comes to beg, if it's a monk they'll say 'Mitabha\", if it's a Taoist they'll say, \"Amita', both means 'Give me money.'\"\n\n\"Then what's 'Good stuff'?\"\n\n\"I said 'Good stuff' because I was thinking, 'How the hell is there another one when two already begged from me?\"\n\nThe old Taoist starts to grimace.\n\n\"Then in the silent debate, what's that one finger?\"\n\nSun Delong however started thinking: Maybe the Emperor is going to punish the old Taoist, and the worst punishment is the nine familial exterminations. If I tell the Emperor about that generation stuff, then even if it's four generations apart it's still not out of the nine. I need to say something else. This is where the old Taoist is finally mentally slain:\n\n\"Your majesty, we were discussing business.\"\n\n\"How so? He sticks one out, you stick two, he then sticks three and you stick five. He slaps his chest and you slap your head. Isn't that silent debate?\"\n\n\"No, your majesty, it's business\"\n\n\"What kind of business?\"\n\n\"He knows I'm a butcher, and in his temple there's going to be a feast, so he wants to buy a pig. I tell him go ahead, I even have two for you. He wants one that's at least three hundred pounds, I tell him I've got ones that's more than five hundred pounds, he asks if the heart, liver and lungs come with it, and I tell him that he can have the pig head too!\"\n\ntl'dr: Chinese xiangsheng piece parallel of the Muslim Ban joke that u/GaryV83_at_Work put up.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I'm a defective parrot.\"\n    \n\"Holy shit,\" the guy replies. \"You actually understood and answered me!\"\n    \n\"I got every word,\" says the parrot.\u201d I happen to be a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird.\"\n    \n\"Oh yeah?\", the guy asks, \"Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?\"\n    \n\"Well,\" the parrot says, \"this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my willie around this wooden bar like a little hook. You can't see it because of my feathers.\"\n\n\"Wow\" says the guy, \"you really can understand and speak English, can't you!?\"\n\n\"Actually, I speak both Spanish and English and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy.

The genie's urn he had left in the tomb where it lay, sealing the room shut when the expedition had left.\n\n\nAfter many years had passed, Benjamin began to have difficulty dealing with his hair. A scraggly mustache and beard drooped down his chin to his chest, and his shoulder-length hair was a constant irritation whenever he looked in the mirror.\n\nFinally, after a day of itching and scratching at his face and head, he gave up. \n\n\"Surely the genie will not carry out the curse. Maybe if I just trimmed my beard a bit, he would let me alone.\"\n\n\nThe next few minutes found Benjamin in his bathroom facing the mirror, scissors in hand. Taking a deep breath, he placed the scissors close to his chin to cut off the ends of his beard. His hand began to close, and just as the first few strands of hair were severed from his body---\n\n\n\"**FOOL!** You ignored my command, and for that, you shall *die*!\" shouted the genie, who appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\nSuddenly, Benjamin was no more, and all that was left was an ancient-looking urn on the ground where his feet had been planted.\n\nAnd that was the end of Benjamin.\n\n\nNow, what can we learn from this sad, sad tale?\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n*A Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.*\n",

He's got good looks, money, a luxurious loft apartment, and a convertible sports car. You can be sure that all of the ladies want him, but of all the things he has, there is one thing that he just wasn't happy with: the size of his penis. \n\nJohn decides he has enough money to get a penis enlargement. I mean, if a woman can get her barely an A mosquito bites exploded into bodacious DD tatas, then why can't he go from teenage Asian to Mandingo? \n\nSo John makes an appointment to see a penis enlargement specialist. \n\nAfter waiting a few days he finally gets into his appointment he has been so anxious about. The surgeon asks: \"So what can I do for you today John?\" to which John replies \"Y'know doc, I'm just not too happy with the size of my penis. It's kind of... ^small.\" The doctor thinks for a minute and then says: \"Well, John, unfortunately I'm fresh out of penises at the moment. We won't really be able to do anything for you until I get my next shipment in a couple months.\" John seems devastated. He can't believe that he has to go on this date knowing this girl will laugh as soon as she catches a glimpse of his little Vienna sausage. He begs the doctor: \"Please! There has to be *something* you can do to help me. I'm begging you!\" The doctor responds: \"Hmm.. give me just a moment.\" He walks out of the room, and returns a few minutes later. \"I have potential good news for you John, but I'm not sure if you're going to be up for it. You see, I'm fresh out of penises, but I *do* have this baby elephant trunk. I know it's a bit odd, but it will make Mandingo looks like a little school boy.\" John thinks for a minute, and decides it isn't such a bad idea. \"Anything is better than what I'm packing right now.\" John says.\n\nJohn schedules the procedure, and ends up recovering a few days before his date. \n\nThe big day comes, and John is more confident than ever. He picks her up in the roadster, makes undeniably confident eye contact, and is making her laugh all the way to the restaurant. Really, everything has been going beautifully. They arrive at a *fancy* restaurant, valet parks his car, and they are seated immediately. A minute later the waiter comes with a basket of bread rolls, places them on the table, and asks what they would like to drink. John orders them both the most expensive bottle of wine they had. The waiter leaves to retrieve the wine while John and his beautiful date look over the menu. John tells her that she can have *anything* she'd like. \"Don't even look at the pricing, money isn't an issue.\" he says. The waiter returns with the wine, and they place their order. While waiting for their food they decide to dig into the rolls. They both get a roll, butter it, and begin eating. Everything seems dandy, and then out of **nowhere** a baby elephant trunk **SHOOTS** up from under the table, grabs a roll, and disappears. John's date was **amazed**. \"**WOAH!** Can you do that again?!\" she said. To which he replied:\n\n\"I can, but I don't think I could fit another roll up my ass.\"\n\n",

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.\nWhen the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, \"All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\n\nBut the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.\n\nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.\n\nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.\n\nWithout even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire\nfighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n\nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n\nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\n\n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!\"",
